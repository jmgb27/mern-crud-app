# mern-crud-app
This GitHub repository contains a simple CRUD application built with TypeScript, MongoDb, Node.js, ReactJS, and Bootstrap. The project demonstrates my ability to create a functional CRUD application using these technologies and includes a server-side Node.js and TypeScript application and a client-side ReactJS and Bootstrap application.
