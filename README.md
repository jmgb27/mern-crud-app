# mern-crud-app
This GitHub repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with TypeScript, MongoDb, Node.js, ReactJS, and Bootstrap. The project is designed to demonstrate my ability to create a functional CRUD application using these technologies. The project includes a server-side application written in Node.js and TypeScript that interacts with a MongoDb database, as well as a client-side application written in ReactJS and Bootstrap that allows users to interact with the CRUD functionality. This project is a great example of my skills in building full-stack web applications using modern technologies.
